## Welcome to this GitHub TSS project page

You can download current version of CMD based TSS: https://github.com/walter-1/TSS/blob/master/tss_tools_v1.71c.zip

### Purpose: 
Multi-purpose Windows CMD based Troubleshooting tool to simplify just-in-time rapid data collection for standard and sporadic issues in in complex environments - or is to be considered as a convenient method for submitting and following simplified action plans.

Copy the tss_tools_*.zip file and expand it to local disk, i.e. into _C:\tools_ folder; in some scenarios we need to find the additional tools either provided in zip or externally i.e. Sysinternals tools in the path, and the script adds PATH and searches in extracted C:\tools by default.

Please start the script in the C:\tools folder in elevated CMD window.

`C:\tools>  tss [parameter list]`

Please invoke the tss command with necessary/appropriate parameters from here.

For help of available parameters just type: **TSS** (or **TSS /help**)
